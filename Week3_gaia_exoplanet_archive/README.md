#### Agenda:
* Intro
* Writing exercise
* NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial
* Gaia Database tutorial
* Discussion Questions for ["Planets around Proxima Centauri"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1706680114)

### Intro

Feel free to share some of your thoughts on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/intro_to_astro/summer2022/intro2astro2022) to continue the discussion!

### Tutorials
1. NASA Exoplanet Archive
  - What is the NASA Exoplanet Archive?
  - What kind of data does it contain?
  - How can I access the data myself?
  - How do I visualize the data?
2. Gaia Database
  - What is Gaia?
  - How can I access Gaia data? Basic and advanced queries.
  - A bit on ADQL
  - Plotting a color-magnitude diagram

### Discussion Questions
1. How does the multiplicity of stellar systems (i.e. single stars vs binaries, triples, etc.) affect the prospects for finding life on planets?
2. Do you think the distance based habitable-zone is a good indicator for possibility to hold life? If you had to distill the "ingredients" for producing intelligent life on a planet down to a short list, what would it be?

## Assignments for this Week

### I NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial
Complete sections 3, 4, and 5 in NASA Exoplanet Archive Jupyter notebook tutorial (see instructions inside notebook).

### II Gaia Database tutorial
The tutorial questions are at the bottom of the 'GaiaTutorialAssignment.ipynb' file. Make sure you try working with ADQL and do some test queries beforehand! You'll be plotting a Color-Magnitude Diagram of the 10,000 Closest Stars.
Bonus Questions:
  - Compare your results against Figure 1 and Figure 2 in this paper: [Babusiaux et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09378.pdf)
  - What similarities and differences do you notice?
  - Challenge 1 : read section 2.1 of this paper and try to reproduce their plot exactly.
  - Challenge 2: Go to Week1 Python and Jupyter Intro.ipynb and try making the 3D plot with the 10,000 closest stars data you fetched
### III Discussion Questions
Choose 2 discussion questions (above) to respond to in your online notebook.

### IV Paper of the Week
Read ["Growth model interpretation of planet size distribution"](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/20/9723) by Li Zeng *et al*. Refer to our [paper reading guide](https://github.com/howardisaacson/Intro-to-Astro-2021/blob/master/Week1_Intro_unix_python/how_to_read_scientific_papers.md). Post 2-3 questions you have about this paper on our class [Piazza](https://piazza.com/intro_to_astro/summer2022/intro2astro2022) page. In addition, please answer at least one of your classmates' questions. You can do this anonymously if you'd like!
